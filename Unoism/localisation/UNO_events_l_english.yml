 unoism.1.t:0 "Unoists Demand a Referendum"
 unoism.1.d:0 "Unoist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The unoists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal unoists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular unoist method of removal: Revolution."
 unoism.1.c:0 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 unoism.2.t:0 "Unoism on the Rise"
 unoism.2.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] unoist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 unoism.2.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 unoism.2.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a unoist coup."
 unoism.2.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 unoism.2.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a unoist uprising."
 unoism.3.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 unoism.3.d:0 "The unoist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Unoist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 unoism.3.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 unoism.4.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Unoist Partisans"
 unoism.4.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the unoist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 unoism.4.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 unoism.5.t:0 "Unoists Rise Up"
 unoism.5.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the unoist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 unoism.5.a:0 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 unoism.5.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 unoism.6.t:0 "Foreign Unoist Influence"
 unoism.6.d:0 "The politics of [Root.GetNamedef] are being influenced by a sovereign Unoist state which is making notable progress towards shaping our country into an Unoist state. We don't have much time left until the Unoists take us over. We must make a difficult decision on whether to support or oppose the threat our country faces."
 unoism.6.a:0 "Unoism is our future. We must accept it."
 unoism.6.b:0 "Fighting them is the only option!"
 unoism.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands [217.GetName]"
 unoism.7.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNamedef] is demanding us to immediately ceded [217.GetName]. [FROM.GetAdjective] people justify that [217.GetName] is a historical area of their beloved ideology of unoism where all the traditions of it came into existence, and only a true swz country can be controlling it. If we decline their demand, they will undoubtedly go to war with us to secure the land they crave."
 unoism.7.a:0 "We must accept."
 unoism.7.b:0 "They will have to take [217.GetName] by force!"
 unoism.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Our Demands"
 unoism.8.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNamedef] has accepted our demands, and [217.GetName] is now under our control."
 unoism.8.a:0 "A wise decision."
 unoism.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Our Demands"
 unoism.9.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNamedef] has refused to accept our demands to cede the birthplace of unoism - [217.GetName]. This decision of the [FROM.GetAdjective] government was not accepted by the loyal supporters of Unoism, and they demand our government to take action."
 unoism.9.a:0 "This can only mean war!"
 unoism.9.b:0 "We are not ready for war yet."
 unoism.11.t:0 "Rapid Industrialisation Programme"
 unoism.11.d:0 "[Root.GetName] must industrialise rapidly to catch up with the rest of the powers. We can choose to put the most effort into industrialising one sector of our industry, or we could keep a balance and industrialise everything at a single pace."
 unoism.11.a:0 "Focus our efforts on the civilian industry."
 unoism.11.b:0 "Focus our efforts on the military industry."
 unoism.11.c:0 "Focus our efforts on both civilian and military industries."
 unoism.12.t:0 "Unoist Uprising!"
 unoism.12.d:0 "Some time has passed since the Unoists of [Root.Getnamedef] have set foot in our country. Our attempts to silence the ideas of Unoism have not succeeded, and in fact, they even backfired as the people got angrier that were are silencing the spreaders of truth. Now the Unoists are well equipped and organised and are ready to challenge our government. They have successfully assassinated the head of our country to lower the morale of our people and have staged many uprisings to establish an Unoist Republic."
 unoism.12.a:0 "We will show them what we got!"
 unoism.13.t:0 "Uno Card Drawn!"
 unoism.13.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] had successfully managed to draw an Uno card. He is about to turn it around to see what he got."
 unoism.13.a:0 "Let's hope for the best."
 unoism.14.t:0 "Rebecca Offers Service"
 unoism.14.d:0 "Rebecca, the most skilled Unoist agent, and a supporter of the Gypsy independence movement in Romania has asked us to consider her offer of becoming an agent and working for us. This offer requires a lot of consideration since gypsies do not give such rich offers without wanting something in return. Rebecca for sure will demand us something sooner or later."
 unoism.14.a:0 "She will be of great use to us."
 unoism.14.b:0 "We don't need any untrustworthy Gypsies."

 unoism.15_legacy.t:0 "Rebecca's Plans Found"
 unoism.15.d:0 "[Root.GetRebeccaDeathDescName]"
 unoism.15_normal.d:0 "Rebecca, our most valuable agent, has proposed an idea to [Root.GetLeader] regarding the creation of an Unoist Gypsy state within the territories of Romania. She wants to call this country Gypsystan and she believes that this new state will serve as a place where all Gypsies can live together in peace and unity. She also added that we need to seriously consider this offer as she said: "Bad things can happen to your country if you do not listen"."
 unoism.15_legacy.d:0 "Many secret plans were discovered in the office of Rebecca - our most valuable agent. These plans had intriguing ideas of creating an Unoist country called Gypsystan in the territories of Romania. The plans say that "Gypsystan will serve as a place where all Gypsies can live together in peace and unity". Rebecca is no longer fighting for Unoism together with us, but her ideas can nevertheless be realised in the coming future."
 unoism.15.a:0 "[GetRebeccaDeathOptionName]"
 unoism.15_normal.a:0 "We will consider the proposal."
 unoism.15_legacy.a:0 "We will consider the option."
 unoism.16.t:0 "Discontent over Unograd"
 unoism.16.d:0 "The decision to establish the Protectorate of Unograd has been met with fierce criticism from our people. Widespread demonstrations broke out, and the people are voicing their support for full reintegration of Unograd as it is the rightful territory of the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
 unoism.16.a:0 "They will have to live with it."
